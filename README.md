# AWS Continuous Integration for Python Application

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a simple Python application. We have set up a **Continuous Integration (CI)** process using **AWS CodePipeline** and **AWS CodeBuild** to automatically build, test, and deploy changes whenever updates are pushed to this repository.

---

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the CI pipeline, ensure you have:

- An AWS account
- A GitHub account
- Permissions to create AWS CodePipeline and CodeBuild resources

---

## Step 1: Set Up GitHub Repository

1. Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in.
2. Click the "+" icon (top-right corner) and select **New repository**.
3. Enter a repository name and optional description.
4. Choose repository visibility (public or private).
5. Initialize the repository with a README file.
6. Click **Create repository**.

---

## Step 2: Create AWS CodePipeline

1. Go to **AWS Management Console** and navigate to **CodePipeline**.
2. Click **Create pipeline**.
3. Provide a name for the pipeline.

### Source stage:

- Select **GitHub** as the source provider.
- Connect your GitHub account.
- Select your repository and the branch you want to use.

### Build stage:

- Select **AWS CodeBuild** as the build provider.
- Click **Create project** to create a new CodeBuild project.
- Follow the steps in Step 3 below to configure CodeBuild.

### Deploy stage (optional):

- Configure deployment using services like **AWS Elastic Beanstalk**, **ECS**, or any other deployment option.

4. Review all settings and click **Create pipeline**.

---

## Step 3: Configure AWS CodeBuild

1. In **AWS Management Console**, navigate to **CodeBuild**.
2. Click **Create build project**.
3. Enter a name for the build project.
4. Under **Source provider**, select **AWS CodePipeline**.
5. Select the pipeline you created earlier.

### Build environment:

- Select the operating system and runtime (e.g., Ubuntu, Python).
- Choose compute resources as needed.

### Build commands:

- Specify the build commands (install dependencies, run tests, etc.)
- You can define these commands in a `buildspec.yml` file in your repository.

### Artifacts:

- Configure artifacts if necessary.

6. Review the settings and click **Create build project**.

---

## Step 4: Trigger Continuous Integration

1. Make any change to your code in the GitHub repository (e.g., fix a bug or add a new feature).
2. Commit and push the changes to the branch configured in CodePipeline.
3. Go to the **AWS CodePipeline** console.
4. Observe that the pipeline automatically starts:

- It fetches the latest code.
- Triggers the CodeBuild process.
- Executes deployment if configured.

5. Review the pipeline stages and logs to monitor the process.

---

## Conclusion

With this setup, every code change automatically goes through the build and deployment process. This allows you to maintain a reliable and automated Continuous Integration pipeline for your Python application using AWS services.
